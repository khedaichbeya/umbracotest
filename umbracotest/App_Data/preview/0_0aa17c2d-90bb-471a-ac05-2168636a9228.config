        <description><![CDATA[<p><span>Hello Everybody!</span><br /><br /><span>Have you ever wanted to impress your friends with a cool physics project? Well you're in luck!!</span><br /><br /><span>My instructable will teach you how to build the simplest kind of heat engine. This instructable is a cheap (roughly $20 cost) and a simple idea to build for a basic physics demonstration. The total time to build takes only an hour from start to finish. The importance of this project stresses the simplicity of demonstrating a simple heat engine through heat energy converted into mechanical motion.</span><br /><span>Building this rubber band heat engine is one of the simplest and coolest ways to demonstrate how work is done through the use of heat. You can also impress your friends by telling them you're building an "engine".</span><br /><br /><strong>What is a heat engine?</strong><br /><span>A heat engine is a machine that converts heat energy into mechanical motion. The Rubberband engine will convert heat energy, using a heat lamp, into a mechanical motion by spinning the wheel.</span><br /><br /><strong>How does this work?</strong><br /><span>Rubber bands react opposite of metals when exposed to hot and cold temperatures. When exposed to a (hot) heat lamp, the rubber bands will contract and become smaller. As they contract, the center axle will shift towards the outer rim of the wheel causing the wheel to become unbalanced. When the wheel is unbalanced, it will cause the weight to shift and begin to spin! Henceforth, heat energy has now been converted into mechanical motion.</span><br /><br /><span>Follow the next 6 steps carefully and you will soon have a fully functional rubber band heat engine!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="step-title">Step 1: Gather the Materials</h2>
<p><img style="width: 0px; height: 0px;" src="/nothing.jpg" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/aa97f53e7b6a4a9ba58773267cc431c4" /><img style="width: 500px; height: 373.5325506937033px;" src="/media/1001/fzz547egu59xe8llarge.jpg?width=500&amp;height=373.5325506937033" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/aa97f53e7b6a4a9ba58773267cc431c4" /></p>
<p><span><strong>Essentials for your rubber band heat engine:</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>- Fully functional bike rim (no tire or rubber tube)</strong><br /></span></p>
<p>The bike rim should be in good shape. Don't use a bent up old rim.</p>
<p><span><strong>- Small bolt cutters</strong></span></p>
<p>Pliers will not cut through the aluminum spokes. You will need a sharp and sturdy pair of small bolt cutters.</p>
<p><span><strong>- Heat lamp bulb</strong></span></p>
<p>You may use a regular heat lamp from any hardware store or you can purchase just the bulb and use a standard desk lamp as the source to put the bulb.</p>
<p><span><strong>- 3inch Rubberbands.</strong></span></p>
<p>Rubber bands react the same to heat no matter what size, shape, or width. However, for the best result, I recommend 3 inch rubber bands that are a little thicker and stronger to hold the wheel and axle together.</p>
<p>After you have these materials gathered, you are now ready to begin building your rubber band heat engine.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class="step-title">Step 2: Marking the Spokes</h2>
<p><img style="width: 400px; height:299px;" src="/media/1002/fvzeeg3gu59xeaxlarge.jpg?width=400&amp;height=299" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/9482cd0661fb4db1bf10e37224eb8bf8" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Measure the length of one spoke.</strong></p>
<p>My bike wheel is 26 inches in diameter. Therefore each spoke has a length of 11.5 inches.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mark 1.75 inches off the tip of the spoke near the axle.<br /><br />3. Mark 1.75 inches off the tip of the small aluminum stud.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>4. Repeat sub-steps 2 and 3 so that every spoke is marked the same around the wheel.</strong><br /><br />Tip: If you don't have a 26 inch diameter bike wheel, no worries. You can still mark 1.75 inches off each end of the spoke because it gives you the best room for the next step, cutting and bending the hooks.</em></p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p class="preamble">When it comes to innovation, digitalization and productivity, the construction industry falls at the bottom of nearly every ranking. It was time for change. Technology startup Ogun teamed up with Aarhus Web Dev Coop to create the first digital platform to bring together construction companies and suppliers and radically improve planning, communication and efficiency.</p>
<h3 class="body-text__heading"><strong>Challenge</strong><img style="font-size: 14px; width: 394px; height: 284px; float: right;" src="http://localhost:52527/media/1008/feature-right.jpg?width=394&amp;height=284&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/5cdff7bf9c404ea19ed87e026e888220" /></h3>
<p>The construction industry is built on steel – and good old-fashioned pen and paper. The steel bars used to reinforce concrete must be made to exact measurements and delivered and installed to precise deadlines to avoid delays to the whole project. As we visited sites across Europe, we saw it was a complicated and inefficient paper-based process, involving a lot of different stages, people, and documentation. So in an age when you can order food, hail a taxi, or even find a date in the click of a button, you’d think there’d be an app for that. But to date there’s been little to no digital innovation in construction – and it’s costing everyone in the industry dearly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="body-text__heading"><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p><img style="width: 444px; height: 231px; float: left;" src="http://localhost:52527/media/1024/bg_1.jpg?width=444&amp;height=231&amp;mode=max" alt="" data-udi="umb://media/5ec308bb313c4960ab879378d11267e6" /></p>
<p>After mapping the complex process together, we redefined the value proposition for Ogun</p>
<p> as a planning tool for the whole supply chain – managing scheduling, fulfillment, delivery, documentation, discussions and notifications. We branded the solution, including naming and logo, and created the interactive and visual language for the tool, highlighting key</p>
<p> information elements for an easy to use interface. Suppliers can see upcoming o</p>
<p>rders, workers can scan incoming materials, and managers can get an overview of their site. <a href="https://ogun.io/en/home/"></a>The result is a flexible solution to improve communication, integration and planning – saving time and money. </p>]]></description>

<p>To get involved with the Web Development team, please follow the steps on<span> </span><a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/?page_id=5913">this page</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Learn Web Development</strong></h2>
<p>For those who do not have web development skills but would like to learn them, we have compiled a list of resources to help you do that. Before you start, here are some general guidelines to follow throughout your learning experience:</p>
<p>– Do all the exercises from the tutorials. Take the time to complete the steps and tasks they give you. Don’t just watch how they do it. Real learning happens when you do it yourself.<br />– Do not copy and paste code. Instead, when a tutorial goes through some code, type it manually yourself. This will help you think about what is actually happening in the code. You will understand it much better if you write it instead of just looking at it.<br />– Try very hard to understand what is happening at every single line of the code that is being analyzed in a tutorial. Take your time and really think it through. What is actually happening in the code and why is it done this way? Sometimes you may just need to give yourself some time and think about it, other times you may need to research it. If you need to research it, it is likely that you would need to read the documentation about the syntax of the language that occurs on the line you don’t understand. (As an example, if we have the code<span> </span>1 !== "1", we might need to read the documentation on integers (like<span> </span>1), on strings (like<span> </span>"1") and on the<span> </span>!==operator.)</p>
